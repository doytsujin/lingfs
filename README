Lingfs is a 9P server that adds filesystem and TCP/IP capabilities to Ling, the
Erlang virtual machine that runs directly on Xen.

Lingfs is based on npfs/spfs 9P library created by Latchesar Ionkov. The major
modification is the addition of a new transport Ethernet frames. The new
transport allows a lightweight communication between Xen guests and the file
server in Dom0.
